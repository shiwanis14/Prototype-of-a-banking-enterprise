The Bank Management System is an application for maintaining a personâ€™s account in a bank. The system provides the access to the costumer to create an account, deposit/withdraw the cash from his account, take loans, cards,insurances and also to use the ATM. The following documentation provides the specification of the system.
We are mainly concerned with developing a banking system where a Customer can submit his/her deposit amount to bank if he/she has an account or can create a new account in this bank. Customer can also view the status ,use the ATM and can view account balance. One can easily maintain the above things if he/she has an account by login through his unique userID.
